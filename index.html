<ul>
  <li>Getting Started - Pieces and parts used by computer vision in the browser</li>
  <li>Web Camera Stream - Using the web camera stream in a video element</li>
  <li>Using Canvas - Putting video stream onto canvas for pixel access</li>
  <li>Grayscale - Turning the web camera feed into grayscale using canvas</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Facial Detection - Find faces in a stream using Viola-Jones algorithm</li>
  <li>Facial Alignment - Determine facial features through constrained local model</li>
  <li>Headtrackr - Face detection library that includes rotation of features</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Drag and Drop - Crash course on drag and drop operations in the browser</li>
  <li>Recognize Text - Perform OCR on dropped content to get textual content</li>
  <li>Speak the Results - Adding Watson to speak the results of the OCR operation</li>
  <li>Video Input - Recognize text from a single frame of a paused video stream</li>
  <li>Thinking Ahead - Can we increase accuracy by looking strictly at the paper?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Color Detection - Sample and track a specific color in a video stream</li>
  <li>Averaging Results - Smooth color tracking by using averages</li>
  <li>Thinking Ahead - What happens when two items of the same color are added?</li>
  <li>Multiple Blobs - Group tracked colors by proximity to one another</li>
  <li>Tracking Library - Comparison of the manual approach to a tracking library</li>
  <li>Thinking Ahead - Does this help us to isolate the paper in the OCR example?</li>
  <li>Gaussian Blur - Apply a gaussian blur to remove image processing artifacts</li>
  <li>Canny and Dilate - Move to a binary image and dilate found edges</li>
  <li>Contours - Turn edge pixels into geometric points in space</li>
  <li>Polygons - Further review contours to approximate polygons</li>
  <li>Rectangles - Isolate rectangles from polygons to narrow down options</li>
  <li>Just the Paper - Revisit OCR but only extract paper based on geometry</li>
  <li>Corner Detection - Feature detection by way of corners in a video stream</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Single Barcode - Scan the web camera video stram until a 2D barcode is found</li>
  <li>QR Code - Scan the web camera video stream until a QR code is found</li>
  <li>Continuous Scanning - Leverage canvas tricks to keep scanning for a barcode</li>
  <li>Pause - Integrate a pause between successful barcode scanning operations</li>
  <li>Toggle Barcode - Add support to toggle from 2D barcode to QR code</li>
  <li>Mobile Scanner - Mobile implementation of a barcode and QR code scanner</li>
  <li>Quagga - Rotation invariant 2D barcode scanning library example</li>
  <li>jsQR - Standalone QR code scanning library example well suited for Node.js</li>
</ul>
